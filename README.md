## Guide for Players

To play with compatible mods, download the PCK, rename it to *Brotato.pck* and place it in your game folder. Then add a mods folder in your game folder and place all compatible mods in there (they should be *.zip* or *.pck*). You can launch Brotato and play with the mods.

## Guide for Modders

First off, if you're new to brotato modding I strongly encourage you to check [Jonuses video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsMA6h7Rd4I).

It's also worth downloading dami's example weapons to see how they're set up (download them [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oggyb3GRWwvf9zH66Bow-EFI7PvSiyNw/view?usp=sharing)).

### Adding the framework to an existing mod

1. Add a folder called *mods* to your project.
1. Add [mod_service.gd](mod_service.gd) & [mod_data.gd](mod_data.gd) to that *mods* folder.
1. Set mod_service.gd to autoload:
    - Project > Project Settings > Autoload
    - Click the folder icon at the top to choose the file
    - Select *mod_service.gd*
    - Leave the name as ModService
    - Click the "Add" button on the right
    - If you're adding DebugLoader too, make sure ModService is listed before it

Now you can export your project as PCK, as usual. Other modders will now be able to add their modded stuff via addon ZIPs, using the effects you've coded in the game.

### Making a Compatible Mod

To make a compatible mod, download the framework zip and place the *mods* folder inside it at the root of your existing project.

Follow the instructions above (adding the framework...) to autoload mod_service.

You can go ahead and mod some weapons, chars or items in.

when you're done, place all your modded stuff into the *mods* folder (I do recommend using subfolders). Then add a new ModData resource at the root of the mods folder (as a *.tres* file). Name it after your mod. Inside it, add all your modded weapons/items/chars data resources to the respective arrays (instead of putting them directly into the `ItemService` arrays).

### Weapons Characters

`weapons_characters` is an array of arrays. It should contain, for each modded weapon, the list of characters that can start with it. It assigns them in the same order as the weapons array so it should have the same length.

For example, if your `weapons` array looks like this:

```GDScript
weapons[0] = wpn_tier1_data.tres
weapons[1] = wpn_tier2_data.tres
```

Then `weapons_characters` might look like this:

```GDScript
# Tier 1 (wpn_tier1_data)
weapons_characters[0] = [
    res://items/characters/well_rounded/well_rounded_data.tres,
    res://items/characters/brawler/brawler_data.tres,
]

# Tier 2 (wpn_tier2_data)
weapons_characters[1] = [
    res://items/characters/knight/knight_data.tres,
]
```

### Packing Your Mod

Now you can pack your mod. I don't recommend exporting as PCK because the file will be quite large. Rather, copy your *.import* and *mods* folder somewhere else. Due to how godot does images and sounds, you'll need to include the files in *.import* that your mod uses. To know which ones to include, you should sort them by date in your explorer, and just delete the ones your mod doesn't use (most of the *.import* folder).

Zip these two folders together and name the .zip it after your mod. It's ready to be loaded along with other mods !!!
